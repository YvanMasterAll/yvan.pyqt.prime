A problem occurred in a Python script.  Here is the sequence of
function calls leading up to the error, in the order they occurred.

 /Users/yiqiang/Work/Workplace/Python/ZzClient/ZzClient/widgets/window.py in eventFilter(self=<__main__.Window object>, obj=<__main__.Window object>, event=<PyQt5.QtCore.QEvent object>)
  145         recursive_set(self)

  147     def eventFilter(self, obj, event):
  148         if type(obj) is Navigation: # 将鼠标跟踪事件传递给子控件, 让子控件不会因为鼠标跟踪事件被接管而无法处理自身的事务
  149             if event.type() == QEvent.MouseButtonPress:
eventFilter undefined
self = <__main__.Window object>
obj = <__main__.Window object>
event = <PyQt5.QtCore.QEvent object>

    __traceback__ = <traceback object>
    args = ()
    with_traceback = <built-in method with_traceback of KeyboardInterrupt object>

The above is a description of an error in a Python program.  Here is
the original traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
